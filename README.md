•Detected cyber threats by identifying anomalous activities in network traffic using the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset.
•Applied algorithms including Incremental PCA, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest.
•Evaluated models using the precision metric, as minimizing false positives was critical for security purposes.
•Achieved the highest precision score of 99.67% using Random Forest, followed by Incremental PCA precision of 88.44%.
